        "sinopsis/abs": "!Oka Tokat was a Philippine paranormal horror-action-thriller drama which originally aired on ABS-CBN from June 24, 1997 to May 7, 2002 every Tuesday night replacing Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata. It starred Ricky Davao, Carmina Villaroel, Diether Ocampo, Jericho Rosales, Angelika Dela Cruz, Rica Peralejo, Paolo Contis, and Agot Isidro. Then later, Shaina Magdayao, Alwyn Uytingco, Joy Chiong, Jiro Manio and Emman Abeleda on its reformat of the series. Its title is the reverse spelling of the phrase Takot ako! (I'm scared!); hence, the exclamation point at the beginning. It was the longest-running horror-action-thriller series on Philippine television, every Tuesday nights right after the local drama TV series Esperanza. Later in November 2001, !Oka Tokat was later reformatted as a horror-comedy adventure series. It revolves around a group of five children (portrayed by Magdayao, Uytingco, Chiong, Manio, and Abeleda) as they visit through numerous haunted places (e.g. Horror House). It was re-aired on ABS-CBN's cable channel, Jeepney TV. This series was also streaming on Jeepney TV's own YouTube Channel every 8:00 pm.",

The film focuses on cultural language and practices that negatively impact the development of a healthy sense of self. The filmmaker's commentary asserts a criticism of the way wavy hair, lighter skin and a slender nose are still considered more attractive in the black community in light of historical and contemporary movements which have sought to liberate black self-esteem. As a practicing and teaching sociologist, the filmmaker sought to illuminate the notion of symbolic violence through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu and spark conversation not just in the black community but all other communities as well. Cultural practices which value some features but not others are issues common to every family and every community. For the filmmaker this is an issue of valuing and finding beauty in every human being.",

        "sinopsis/abs": "'Allo 'Allo! is a British sitcom television series, created by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, starring Gorden Kaye, Carmen Silvera, Guy Siner and Richard Gibson. Originally broadcast on BBC1, the series focuses on the life of a French café owner in the town of Nouvion, during the German occupation of France in the Second World War, in which he deals with problems from a dishonest German officer, local French Resistance, the handling of a stolen painting and a pair of trapped airmen, all while concealing from his wife the affairs he is having with his waitresses. Croft and Lloyd devised the concept as a parody of BBC wartime drama Secret Army and initially launched the programme with a pilot on 30 December 1982. The sitcom was eventually commissioned following the success of the pilot and ran for nine series between 7 September 1984 until its conclusion on 14 December 1992. Both Lloyd and Croft wrote the scripts for the first six series, while the remainder were handled by Lloyd and Paul Adam. Much like previous sitcoms created by Croft and Lloyd, the programme employed notable elements such as memorable catchphrases and ending credits, cultural clichés, physical humour and visual gags. However, 'Allo 'Allo! differed from these other sitcoms by featuring overarching plot lines rather than simple stand-alone stories, as well as the device of having actors speaking English but with theatrical foreign accents to distinguish each character's nationality. The sitcom gained respectable ratings during its run, with its success leading to it receiving stage show reproductions. A special entitled The Return of 'Allo 'Allo!, aired on 22 March 2007, featured cast members returning to reprise their original roles to perform in a special story after the conclusion of the programme. It was accompanied by a documentary about the sitcom, including a highlight reel of episodes and interviews with the cast, production team and fans.",

The floor of the Chinese mental institution houses 50 male patients who are there for killing someone, committing a crime against a public official, or have a developmental disability. It is not clearly stated why the men are in the mental institution, adding to the observational approach of the documentary. The documentary film uses handheld camerawork and digital video to capture the relationship between society and individuals. Towards the end of the film, one of the patients is allowed to return to his home village. It creates a contrast to the isolation and atmosphere of the mental institution.",
